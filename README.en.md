# Code analysis and automated refactor

PS: This introduction is based on the tool set in [Modernizing](https://github.com/modernizing).

Modernizing legacy system is a long-term issue, and a fine art. During our daily work, we may always face a series of questions:

One of the solutions to these problems is **automated tools**. These tools are supported by a set of **principles** and **patterns** that are integrated into the tools. Another solution for team member growth is: meta-meta, which is another story. For daily working, it is the analysis of code and the subsequent automated refactoring.
